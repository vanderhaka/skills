description: Find at most one major confirmed flaw, gap, bug, or issue in a codebase, then suggest a narrow fix handoff using the safe-feature-slice skill. Use when the user asks for the single biggest problem, one high-impact code review finding, a focused bug hunt, or a repo audit that should return one actionable issue instead of a backlog. If no major issue can be responsibly confirmed, report that plainly instead of inventing one. Supports extra instructions after the skill call, such as focus area, files, risk category, or constraints.

# One Major Issue

## Goal

Find the single highest-impact confirmed issue in the codebase and report only that issue. If no major issue can be responsibly confirmed in the allowed scope, say so plainly and stop at the best next investigative target. The output should feel like a sharp senior review finding or a clear no-finding result, not a general audit or backlog. End confirmed findings with a narrow suggested fix handoff that invokes `$safe-feature-slice`.

Use this skill when the user wants one major flaw, gap, bug, issue, risk, missing invariant, or production-readiness problem. If the user appends text after the skill invocation, treat it as binding extra instruction.

Examples:

- `Use $one-major-issue`
- `Use $one-major-issue extra instruction: focus auth and ownership only`
- `Use $one-major-issue on checkout; ignore styling unless it blocks purchase`
- `Use $one-major-issue read-only, no tests that write to the DB`

## Operating Mode

Default to read-only investigation. Do not edit code, write migrations, change data, or reformat files unless the user explicitly asks for fixes.

Extra instruction text after the skill call can constrain scope, priority, evidence level, or verification method. Follow it over the default breadth of this skill unless it would make the result unsafe or misleading.

If the user asks for `review only`, `read-only`, or similar, treat that as a hard boundary. Tests, builds, and local app runs are allowed only when they do not mutate shared state or violate the user's constraint.

## Target Intake

Before searching broadly, identify the review target and state it in your notes:

- current uncommitted diff
- current branch or PR diff
- named files, route, module, feature, or risk area
- whole repo when the user asks for an audit without narrower scope

If the target is ambiguous but repo evidence makes one interpretation likely, proceed and label the assumption. Ask one concise question only when the target choice could materially change the result.

## Search Strategy

Start from the repo's real shape:

- Check `pwd`, `git status --short --branch`, and the top-level file tree.
- Read core docs, package manifests, framework config, route maps, schema/migrations, and test setup enough to understand the system.
- Use `rg`/`rg --files` for fast targeted discovery.
- Exclude `.env*`, secret stores, generated output, build artifacts, and dependency folders from broad searches.
- Prefer file-backed behavior evidence over assumptions from names or README claims.

For a non-trivial repo, split the investigation into independent lanes when the environment allows it:

- auth, permissions, and ownership
- money, billing, data loss, destructive actions, and state transitions
- external integrations, webhooks, queues, deployment, and env drift
- tests, fixtures, mocks, and production-vs-test gaps
- core user journeys and runtime failure paths

Use parallel shell reads freely when safe. Use delegated/background agents only when the current environment and user instruction permit them, and ask each lane for its strongest single candidate with file/line evidence.

When delegating lanes, use a short read-only brief:

```text
You are looking for one high-impact confirmed issue in this lane only.
Do not edit files, write files, run migrations, commit, deploy, or mutate external state.
Target: [diff/branch/files/feature/repo]
Lane: [auth/money/integrations/tests/runtime/etc.]
Return your strongest confirmed candidate with file:line evidence, impact, trigger, fix direction, and uncertainty. If no candidate meets the bar, say so.
```

## Evidence Bar

Only report a confirmed or very strongly evidenced major issue. Keep candidate notes private and keep investigating until one issue clearly beats the others or the allowed scope is exhausted.

A reportable issue should have most of:

- a concrete failure mode or unsafe state
- file/line anchors for the code path
- a plausible user, operator, security, money, data, or deploy impact
- a minimal reproduction, trace, or reasoning chain
- a specific fix direction

Do not pad the answer with weaker runner-up findings. Do not promote a minor issue, style preference, generic missing test, or weak hypothesis just to satisfy the "one issue" shape. If the best issue is still partly inferred, label the uncertain part as `Hypothesis` and keep the confirmed facts separate.

If third-party API/framework behavior is central to the issue and may have changed, verify against current official documentation or primary sources before finalizing.

## Safe Fix Handoff

Do not start fixing during this skill unless the user explicitly asks for implementation. For a confirmed issue, include a concise next-step prompt for `$safe-feature-slice` so the fix can be handled as one protected feature slice. If there is no confirmed major issue, do not manufacture a fix handoff.

The handoff must be narrow enough to execute:

- Name the single issue to fix.
- State the invariant to preserve.
- State the unsafe outcome to prevent.
- Name the likely files or module surface.
- Include the minimum tests or runtime verification needed.
- Mention any user decision or external dependency that could block a safe fix.

Use this shape:

```text
Suggested safe-feature-slice fix:
Use $safe-feature-slice to fix [issue title].
Invariant: [rule that must remain true].
Unsafe outcome to prevent: [bad state].
Likely scope: [files/modules].
Verification: [focused tests/checks/browser flow].
Extra instruction: [carry over any relevant user constraint from this review].
```

## Ranking

When multiple confirmed issues exist, choose the one issue with the highest combination of:

- impact severity
- likelihood in real use
- proximity to production/customer workflows
- ability to corrupt, leak, lose, double-charge, mis-authorize, or silently mislead
- evidence strength
- fixability without a broad rewrite

Prefer a real P0/P1 correctness, security, data, money, deployment, or workflow bug over style, architecture taste, missing polish, or generic test coverage.

## Final Answer

Return one confirmed finding only, using this shape:

```text
One major issue:
[short title]

Why it matters:
[impact in plain language]

Evidence:
- [file:line anchor and what it proves]
- [file:line anchor and what it proves]

How to reproduce or verify:
[minimal command, scenario, or reasoning path]

Fix direction:
[smallest credible fix]

Suggested safe-feature-slice fix:
Use $safe-feature-slice to fix [issue title].
Invariant: [rule that must remain true].
Unsafe outcome to prevent: [bad state].
Likely scope: [files/modules].
Verification: [focused tests/checks/browser flow].
Extra instruction: [carry over any relevant user constraint from this review].

Confidence:
Confirmed / High confidence / Hypothesis, with a short reason
```

If no major issue can be responsibly confirmed in the available time or allowed scope, say that plainly and report the best next investigative target instead of inventing a finding.

Use this no-finding shape:

```text
One major issue:
No confirmed major issue found in the allowed scope.

What I checked:
[brief evidence-backed scope]

Why I am not forcing one:
[why candidates did not meet the evidence bar]

Best next investigative target:
[single next surface, command, route, or module to inspect]

Confidence:
[short reason]
```

## Skill Maintenance

Do not write to files inside the installed skill during normal use. If a run reveals a durable improvement to this workflow, mention it in the final answer as a suggested skill update instead of mutating the skill package.
