# Logic Ripple

## What This Skill Does

`logic-ripple` maps the blast radius of a business or domain rule change before implementation. It finds where the same rule should change, where similar logic is intentionally different, and where duplicate rule logic should be canonicalized.

## Use It When

- You are changing pricing, tax, GST, discounts, totals, entitlements, permissions, validation, or state transitions.
- You want to know where else the same rule needs to apply.
- You suspect similar code paths calculate or enforce the same rule differently.
- You want a report and fix menu before any edits happen.
- You need a research gate for rules that may depend on tax, legal, accounting, provider, or framework behavior.

## How It Works

The skill starts by writing a rule contract, then searches by meaning rather than only text. It classifies every candidate as `Must Fix`, `Probably Same Rule`, `Canonicalization Candidate`, `Intentionally Different`, `Do Not Touch`, or `Research Recommended`.

When research is needed and the user did not already ask for it, the skill keeps ambiguous items out of the fix menu and asks with the final report whether to research before promoting them.

## What You Get

- A rule contract and assumptions.
- Required ripple fixes ranked by severity.
- Similar-looking areas that may not be the same rule.
- Canonicalization opportunities where one helper or domain owner would reduce drift.
- Research recommendations when repo context is not enough.
- A hard-stop fix menu before implementation.

## Not For

Use `bug-ripple` when one concrete bug suggests sibling bugs. Use `code-review` for a PR, diff, or broader code-quality audit. Use `safe-feature-slice` when you already know the fix scope and are ready to implement.
