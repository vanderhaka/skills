```

If the flow stops early, say exactly why:

- no relevant changes
- dry-run complete
- verify complete
- ambiguous staging scope
- explicit no-push / local-only request
- verification failure after repair attempts
- freshness/divergence block
- push rejection
- deployment recovery blocker

Keep the transcript concise. It should be enough for handoff/debugging, not a full terminal log.
