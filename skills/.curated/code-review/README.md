# Code Review

## What This Skill Does

`code-review` reviews a diff, branch, PR, focused file set, or implementation plan for real issues. It prioritizes bugs, regressions, safety risks, missing tests, merge-readiness problems, and harsh structural maintainability findings over style nits.

This skill owns the strict thermo/code-judo review bar directly. Use it as the default review skill instead of reaching for a separate thermo-nuclear review.

For TypeScript and JavaScript reviews, this skill strictly calls `fallow` before
finalizing so structural-analysis evidence is always reported or explicitly
skipped with a reason.

## Use It When

- You ask for a code review.
- You want to know if a branch is safe to merge.
- You want current local changes audited.
- You want a strict review or a focused review of one area.
- You want a harsh structural review for spaghetti branching, file sprawl, wrong-layer logic, unnecessary abstractions, casts, or missed simplification.
- You want review findings before deciding what to fix.

## How It Works

The skill identifies the review target, reads the relevant code and repo rules, inspects behavior and risk surfaces, then reports findings ordered by severity. It applies a strict structural approval bar by default: working code is not enough if the implementation makes the codebase more tangled.

It routes only genuinely different workflows to specialist skills, such as `launch-critical-sweep` for go-live blockers or `cap` for final ship verification.

## What You Get

- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- File and line references.
- Impact and fix direction.
- Behavior preservation and structural quality confidence.
- Required Fallow structural-analysis evidence for JS/TS reviews.
- Open questions or assumptions.
- Brief summary only after the findings.

## Not For

Use `issue-fix-strategy` when you already have a pile of issues and want plain-English prioritization. Use `cap` when the work is already fixed and needs to be committed.
